# 🧠 PromptShell

### "Swap the prompt. Shape the mind. Speak your bot into being."

**PromptShell** is a local-first, voice-powered AI assistant shell that can be instantly customized by swapping out a prompt file. It runs entirely on your laptop, listens to your voice, transcribes it locally using Whisper, and sends the text to Gemini 1.5 for intelligent, real-time responses.

No browser. No cloud audio. Just you, your voice, and your bot.

## 💪 Core Code Components

### `main.py`

```python
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import scrolledtext
import keyboard
import sounddevice as sd
import numpy as np
import tempfile
import scipy.io.wavfile as wav
import whisper
import requests
from docx import Document
import threading

DEVICE_INDEX = 3
SAMPLE_RATE = 48000
API_KEY = "your-api-key"
GEMINI_MODEL = "google/gemini-flash-1.5"
model = whisper.load_model("base")

def load_prompt(path="prompt.docx"):
    try:
        doc = Document(path)
        return "\n".join([p.text for p in doc.paragraphs if p.text.strip()])
    except:
        return "You are a helpful assistant."

system_prompt = load_prompt()

# Add additional functions for recording, transcription, and Gemini calls below

Built by [Sarath Lella](https://linkedin.com/in/sarath-lella).PromptShell was originally created in a day to help a non-technical family member interact with AI—without opening a browser or typing a thing. Since then, it’s become a modular voice-first AI framework that can transform into anything: mentor, buddy, coach, or co-pilot.
