# promptshell
PromptShell is a local-first, voice-powered AI assistant shell that can be instantly customized by swapping out a prompt file. It runs entirely on your laptop, listens to your voice, transcribes it locally, and sends the text to an LLM for intelligent, real-time responses.  No browser. No cloud audio. Just you, your voice, and your bot.
